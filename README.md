NBA Schedule Difficulty Analysis

This project examines NBA schedule difficulty through a data-driven approach using historical scheduling and team performance data. The analysis evaluates schedule density, travel demands, back-to-back games, and their impact on team outcomes between 2014 and 2024. The study is structured to reflect the type of analytics work performed in a professional sports front office.

Purpose

The structure of the NBA schedule plays a measurable role in player fatigue, competitive balance, and team performance. By quantifying schedule intensity and modeling its effects on outcomes, this project demonstrates how analytics can be applied to evaluate fairness, uncover structural trends, and inform strategic decision-making.



Objectives

Identify and measure 4-in-6 stretches (four games in six nights) for each team and season

Evaluate schedule density trends across the past decade

Assess the effect of back-to-backs on defensive performance metrics

Develop visual tools to highlight schedule anomalies and travel demands

Model the estimated impact of scheduling on team win totals (2019â€“2024)



Tools and Technologies

Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly

Jupyter Notebook for analysis and reporting

Provided NBA datasets (schedule, locations, game performance)



Key Analyses

Schedule Density: Identification of 4-in-6 stretches normalized to an 82-game schedule

Team Comparisons: Determination of teams most and least impacted by congested schedules

Trend Analysis: Examination of how league scheduling practices have evolved over ten years

Custom Visualizations: Season-level plots highlighting high-density stretches and travel burdens
