#  NBA Schedule Difficulty Analysis

This project explores **NBA schedule difficulty** using team- and league-level data. The analysis covers **schedule density, travel stretches, back-to-backs, and the impact on team performance** from 2014‚Äì2024. It‚Äôs designed as a real-world style analytics project ‚Äî similar to what an NBA front office data team might work on.

##  Project Objectives
- Identify **4-in-6 stretches** (4 games in 6 nights) across seasons and teams.  
- Compare **schedule density trends** over the last decade.  
- Measure the effect of **back-to-backs (B2B)** on team defensive efficiency.  
- Build **visual tools** to highlight travel demands and congested stretches.  
- Model the impact of scheduling on **wins gained/lost** (2019‚Äì2024).
